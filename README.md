# UI Developer Code Challenge

This repository contains the solution to the UI Developer Code Challenge.

## Approach

- I have used **HTML5** and **CSS3** as per the instructions.
- The base font is **Arial**.
- Media queries are used for breakpoints in SASS to ensure the design is responsive across devices.
- **No Bootstrap** was used in the implementation.

## Image Optimization

- All images used in the project have been **compressed** to reduce file size and improve page load time.

## Notes

- The UI is fully responsive, and I have tested it on different screen sizes.
- I ignored custom fonts and used Arial as the base font as per the instructions.
